# Tensorflow-NMT-Tutorial-PTB
This repository contains preprocessing and postprocessing code for Penn Treebank data to prepare the data for use with the Tensorflow Neural Machine Translation tutorial (See https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt).
The preprocessing and postprocessing code have been restored after a computer failure.
